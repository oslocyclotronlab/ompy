"""
Class mc(), the Monte Carlo module in pyma. 
It handles generation of random ensembles of spectra with 
statistical perturbations, and can make first generation variance matrices.

---

This is pyma, the python implementation of the Oslo method.
It handles two-dimensional matrices of event count spectra, and
implements detector response unfolding, first generation method
and other manipulation of the spectra.

It is heavily inspired by MAMA, written by Magne Guttormsen and others,
